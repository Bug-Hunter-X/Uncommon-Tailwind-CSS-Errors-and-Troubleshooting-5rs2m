The issue lies in the Tailwind CSS configuration or its implementation within your project.  A common problem is an incorrect or missing `purge` (or `content`) option in your `tailwind.config.js` file. This option tells Tailwind which HTML files to scan for used classes. If it's missing or configured incorrectly, many classes will be purged, resulting in unexpected errors.  Another possibility is a conflict between Tailwind's utility classes and other CSS styles.  Incorrectly importing or applying custom CSS might override Tailwind classes, causing unexpected behavior.
