# Uncommon Tailwind CSS Errors and Solutions

This repository demonstrates troubleshooting uncommon errors encountered when using Tailwind CSS.  Specifically, it addresses issues related to incorrect purging of CSS classes and CSS conflicts.

## Problem 1: Incorrect Purge Configuration
The `tailwind.config.js` file is crucial for specifying which files Tailwind scans for used CSS classes.  If this isn't set correctly, many classes get purged unnecessarily, leading to unexpected rendering issues.  A common error is forgetting to specify the `content` option or providing an incorrect path.
