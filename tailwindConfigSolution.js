To fix the purge configuration issue, ensure the `content` option in `tailwind.config.js` accurately points to your HTML, Vue, or React files.  Here's how to do it correctly:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ['./index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,vue}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Make sure to replace the paths with your actual file locations.  If you're using a framework like Next.js, consult its documentation for framework-specific configurations.

To handle CSS conflicts, ensure proper CSS specificity.  Try using !important (although sparingly), or adjusting your CSS order to ensure Tailwind classes take precedence.  Using a CSS-in-JS solution can help to keep Tailwind and custom styling separated, making conflict resolution easier.
